		<p>
			Since, Eduard C. Lindeman's pioneer paper in 1926, The Meaning of Adult Education, which awakened interest in
			and
			set the basis for the systematic research about how adults learn, educators and psychologists have contributed
			to
			the
			development of many varied theories and hypothesis about the learning characteristics of adults. Taylor and
			Hamdy
			summarized the learning theories and classified them in the <span class="tooltip"

		<div class="andragogy">
			<h3 id="a2"><mark>Andragogy</mark></h3>

			<p class="note">The essential meaning of the concept of andragogy has to do with adults. The Greek, aner
				(genitive andros), means “man”, while agein means “to lead”; so andragogy means “leading men,” which can be
				paraphrased as “leading adults”. <br>Knowles defined andragogy as “the art and science of helping adults
				learn”.</p>

			<p>In the 1970s, Malcolm S. Knowles developed a model to explain the characteristics of learning in adults
				based
				in the following assumptions:</p>

			<h4>The need to learn</h4>

			<p>Adults need to know why they need to learn something before undertaking to learn it. They need to know how
				learning will be conducted, what learning will occur and why learning is important. The pedagogical
				implications
				of this assumption are that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="content_item">It is important to know and understand the learner's expectations and needs through
					needs assessments
					(an
					evaluation of what the learner needs to know about the subject matter, performed prior to the teaching
					intervention by asking teachers and/or students). These allow for appropriate planning, in order to avoid
					the mistake of teaching content so basic that students already know it (the lecture is viewed as a waste
					of
					time) or so difficult that they find it impossible to understand (they lack the knowledge base to
					understand
					the content) or they find it irrelevant to their needs
				</li>
				<li class="content_item">It is fundamental to introduce goals and objectives at the beginning of the lecture
					- what learners will
					be
					able to know or do with the knowledge acquired during the lecture</li>
				<li class="content_item">It is good practice to present an outline at the beginning of the lecture to give
					the learners a preview
					of
					what they will learn.</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>The learner's self-concept</h4>
			<p>Adults have the self-concept of being responsible of their own decisions and their own lives and
				consequently
				need
				to be considered by others as capable of self-direction. Teachers should help their adult students become
				self-directed learners: Learners that are able to control, motivate, supervise and adjust their own
				learning.36
				Encouraging active learning (where students actively participate in their learning – through debates,
				questioning,
				case
				resolution) over passive learning (where students just sit back and expect to be ‘fed’ by the teacher) is
				one
				strategy for
				helping students make a transition from dependent to self-directed learners.</p>

			<h4>The role of learner's experiences</h4>
			<p>Adults come to learning situations with accumulated experience; therefore, in any group of adults there is a
				wide
				range of individual differences regarding background, learning styles, motivation, needs, interests and
				goals.
				Also, adults tend to develop mental habits, biases and assumptions that usually make them resistant to new
				ideas
				and
				alternative methods of learning.</p>
			<p class="note">This concept suggests the inclusion of techniques that take into consideration the learner's’
				experience. Group discussions, debates, case-based methods, etc., are examples of techniques in which
				students
				may
				evaluate, reflect
				and review their own experience in light of what is being taught. Additionally, constructivist learning
				theories
				suggest that new information must connect to previous knowledge in order to be understood, retained and then
				utilized.</p>

			<h4>Readiness to learn</h4>
			<p>Adults are ready to learn what they need to know to cope with the situations they face in their real lives.
				This
				principle supports the relationship between the content to be taught and the learner's developmental stage.
				For
				example, a lecture about phacoemulsification with premium intraocular lenses might not be relevant for
				first-year
				residents, although it would be useful for third-year residents.</p>

			<h4>Orientation to learning</h4>
			<p>Adults will be motivated to learn as long as they perceive the learning as useful to help them perform tasks
				or
				solve problems they face in their lives. They will learn more effectively when new knowledge, skills,
				attitudes
				and values are presented in the context of their application to real life situations.</p>
			<p class="note">This concept implies that the content of lectures should be relevant to what learners need to
				cope
				with in their daily practice. The instructor's experience on the subject matter (presented through personal
				stories or cases) adds to the relevance that the audience may find in the content.</p>

			<h4>Motivation</h4>
			<p>Although adults respond to external motivators (better jobs, promotions, higher salaries, etc.) the most
				powerful
				motivators for learning are internal pressures (the desire for increased job satisfaction, self-esteem,
				quality
				of
				life, etc.).</p>
			<p class="note">Letting learners know why they need to know a topic or what they will be able to do with the
				knowledge acquired
				from the lecture (i.e., to present goals and objectives) can increase motivation during lectures, as well as
				the
				inclusion of activities, debates and question.</p>

		<h3 id="a3"><mark>Active</mark> learning</h3>
		<p>In this teaching model, the learner actively participates in <span class="tooltip"

				learning</span>. Active learning implies that:</p>

		<ul>
			<li class="content_item">Learners are involved in more than listening</li>
			<li class="content_item">Less emphasis is placed on transmitting information and more on developing a student's
				skills</li>
			<li class="content_item">Learners are involved in higher order thinking (analysis, synthesis and evaluation)
			</li>
			<li class="content_item">Students are engaged in activities (e.g., reading, discussion and writing)</li>
			<li class="content_item">Greater emphasis is placed on the student's exploration of his/her own values and
				attitudes.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="note">Strategies promoting active learning include questions and debates, reflective activities and
			small
			group discussions, case studies, role-playing and more. Several authors suggest that active learning techniques
			may have greater effectiveness in medicine and other disciplines.</p>

		<h3 id="a4"><mark>Experiential</mark> learning</h3>
		<p>This model, developed by David A. Kolb, considers the learning process as a “cycle of experience”, which
			consists
			of <span class="tooltip"
				title="Kolb DA. Experiential learning: Experience as the source of learning and development. 1 st ed. Upper Saddle River (NJ): Prentice Hall; 1983. p. 20-38. ">4
				steps:</span></p>
		<ol>
			<li class="content_item">The learner lives a concrete experience</li>
			<li class="content_item">He/she observes and reflects on the experience from different perspectives</li>
			<li class="content_item">He/she forms abstract concepts and generalizations</li>
			<li class="content_item">He/she assesses the implications of the new concepts in new situations.</li>

		<p>This model suggests the inclusion of a variety of strategies during lectures, such as simulations, case
			studies,
			demonstrations and group discussions. The instructor uses these strategies to help the learner through the
			different steps of learning from the experience.</p>
		<p>This perspective is based on constructivist learning theories, which state that knowledge is linked to the
			context
			in which it occurs and that learning occurs from experience according to the personal meaning individuals give
			to
			it. The role of teaching is to provide contexts and assistance that helps individuals find meaning in knowledge
			according to the environment in which they perform.</p>

		<h3 id="a5"><mark>Reflective</mark> learning</h3>
		<p>Donald A. Schön highlighted the importance of fostering reflection about what happens and why it happens,
			personal
			beliefs and feelings, errors, gaps and possible variables, in order to achieve meaningful learning when
			teaching
			professionals.31,37,48 Reflection during lectures may be encouraged through <b>dialogues, questions and
				debates.</b></p>

		<h3 id="a6"><mark>Superficial</mark> versus deep learning</h3>
		<p>This concept refers to the preference by which students approach learning. Some prefer a deeper understanding
			(deep learning); others prefer to acquire only the facts (superficial learning). This preference is usually
			determined by content, context, needs and previous knowledge of the topic. Students tend to “strategically”
			choose
			how they learn topics according to the circumstances.49 Additionally, the evaluation system can condition the
			learning style. If the evaluation is based on recalling/reciting of facts, students willing to pass will choose
			a
			superficial approach. The use of reflection using questions and discussion during lectures promotes a deeper
			approach to learning.</p>

		<h3 id="a7">The learning <mark>process</mark></h3>
		<p>Taylor and Hamdy propose a 5-stage process to explain how <span class="tooltip" title="Taylor DC, Hamdy H. Adult learning theories: Implications for learning and teaching in medical education:
		AMEE Guide No. 83. Med Teach 2013;35:e1561-72">learning occurs:</span></p>

		<dl>
			<dt>Dissonance:</dt>
			<dd>The learner's existing knowledge is challenged and found to be incomplete</dd>
			<dt>Refinement:</dt>
			<dd>The learner seeks out possible explanations or solutions to a problem (elaboration) and through
				completing tasks, research, reflection and discussion refines the new information into new concepts</dd>
			<dt>Organization:</dt>
			<dd>The learner develops or restructures ideas considering the newly acquired information, making sense of it
				and
				organising it into schemata</dd>
			<dt>Feedback:</dt>
			<dd>The learner articulates new knowledge and tests it against what his peers and teachers think which
				reinforces
				the schema or obliges its reconsideration</dd>
			<dt>Consolidation:</dt>
			<dd>New reflection occurs about what was learned and how learning occurred.</dd>

			Teachers and learners have varied roles according to the stage; providing organizers (objectives, structure),
			encouraging reflection and giving feedback are key activities that should be integrated into lectures.

		<div class="sum">
			<h2 id="a8">Summary</h2>
			<p>In summary, current theories of adult learning emphasize that:</p>
			<ul type="disc">
				<li class="content_item">Learners need to have clear goals and objectives of what they will achieve by the
					teaching intervention
					(e.g.,
					the
					lecture)</li>
				<li class="content_item">Content should be relevant and useful to the learner's real life</li>
				<li class="content_item">Content should be connected to experience and previous knowledge</li>
				<li class="content_item">Learners should reflect about what they learn and how they learn</li>
				<li class="content_item">Learners should actively participate in their learning</li>
				<li class="content_item">Teaching should be learner-centred, i.e., consider theories by which adults learn
					and implement the most
					adequate strategies that help them learn, according to their needs, objectives and the context</li>
				<li class="content_item">The teacher's role changes from being a “transmitter” of knowledge to a
					“facilitator”, that assists the
					students in their own learning, provides relevance to the content, offers examples of application to
					practice, invites reflection, motivates and helps to provide significant meaning to new knowledge.</li>
